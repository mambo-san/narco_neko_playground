          <summary>Overview</summary>
          <p>
              Welcome to Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) Simulation.
        </p>
          <p>
              This simulation evolves simple digital organisms on a grid. 
              Each cell has a neural network encoded in DNA that determines how it senses, moves, and survives. 
              Over generations, fitter cells reproduce and pass on their genes, while the system tracks survival rate and genetic diversity.

    <summary>Reproduction Zone Mechanism</summary>
        <p>
            A cell accumulates reproduction weight the longer it stays in the survival zone. 
            Additionally, if it ends the generation inside the zone, it receives a bonus. 
            This weight influences how likely the cell is to pass on its genome to the next generation. 
            The survival zone's shape can be adjusted (edge, corners, center, etc.).
        </p>

        <summary>Inspecting Cell</summary>
        <p>
            Clicking on a living cell opens a floating panel showing its neural network. 
            The network's structure is visualized as graph or text, allowing you to see how the cell processes inputs and generates outputs.
        </p>
        <p >
            When you select a cell, you'll notice that multiple cells are selected. Here's why:
                Each cell's DNA structure (abstract signature) is recorded at the begginging of the generation.
                This signature ignores connection weights and focuses only on the nodes and links involved.
                All cells with the same signature (same neural network topology) are grouped together.
                This allows you to see how many cells share the same DNA structure, even if their weights differ.
                This grouping helps visualize genetic diversity and how many cells share similar neural network designs.
